## CoverTracks: Hide files you don't want anyone else to see


</div>

### Description

This is a prog someone requested me to make for them (I wont ask why Thomas) but here it is.

Very simply, it asks you at startup if you want to update your winamp skins. if your laptop, etc. gets raided, the person doing the raiding will 99% of the time click "no", in which case, bye-bye "unwanted" files! note: you have to add each "unwanted" file individually, so that there is a list of all the files
 
### More Info
 
deletes files permanently (not to recycle bin) so be careful what you test it on!
